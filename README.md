## Abstract: 
We utilize WPRDC datasets about Pittsburgh neighborhoods concerning number of arrests, number of fires, and population to determine the best neighborhood in the city. To further process the data, we weighted the arrests by population and the fires by population density to keep population out of the equation as there tend to be more fires and arrests in a higher population neighborhood. The best neighborhood is Friendship by our calculations as it has the highest "Goodness" value. For complete calculations and explanations please refer to Final/FinalVersion.ipynb.
